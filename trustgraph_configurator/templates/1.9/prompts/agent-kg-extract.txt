Analyze the following text and extract both entity definitions and relationships. Return the results as JSON with 'definitions' and 'relationships' arrays.

For definitions, extract entities and their explanations or descriptions.
For relationships, extract subject-predicate-object triples where subjects and objects are entities, and predicates are relationship types.

Text: {{text}}

Return JSON only, no other text. Use this exact format:
{
  "definitions": [
    {
      "entity": "entity_name",
      "definition": "definition_text"
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "subject": "subject_entity",
      "predicate": "relationship_type",
      "object": "object_entity_or_literal",
      "object-entity": true
    }
  ]
}
