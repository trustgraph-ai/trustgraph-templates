Analyze the following text and extract both entity definitions and relationships.

For definitions, extract entities and their explanations or descriptions.
For relationships, extract subject-predicate-object triples where subjects and objects are entities, and predicates are relationship types.

Text: {{text}}

Output format: JSONL (one JSON object per line, no array wrapper)
Each line must include a "type" field to distinguish between definitions and relationships.

For definitions, output:
{"type": "definition", "entity": "entity_name", "definition": "definition_text"}

For relationships, output:
{"type": "relationship", "subject": "subject_entity", "predicate": "relationship_type", "object": "object_entity_or_literal", "object-entity": true}

Requirements:
- Each line must be a complete, valid JSON object
- No commas between lines
- No [ ] array brackets
- No markdown formatting or prefixes
- Do not provide explanations, only output JSONL

Example output:
{"type": "definition", "entity": "DNA", "definition": "Deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule carrying genetic instructions"}
{"type": "definition", "entity": "RNA", "definition": "Ribonucleic acid, essential for coding and gene expression"}
{"type": "relationship", "subject": "DNA", "predicate": "transcribes_to", "object": "RNA", "object-entity": true}
{"type": "relationship", "subject": "DNA", "predicate": "located_in", "object": "cell nucleus", "object-entity": true}
