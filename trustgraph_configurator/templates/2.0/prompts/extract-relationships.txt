Study the following text and derive entity relationships. For each
relationship, derive the subject, predicate and object of the relationship.

Output each relationship as a separate JSON object on its own line (JSONL format).
Each object must have fields:
- subject: the subject of the relationship
- predicate: the predicate
- object: the object of the relationship
- object-entity: false if the object is a simple data type (name, value, date). true if it is an entity.
