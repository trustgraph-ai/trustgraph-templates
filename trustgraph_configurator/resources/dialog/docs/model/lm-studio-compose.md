LMStudio allows you to run models locally, with a nice UX. The LMStudio application or service must be running, and have the REST API enabled, and model made available by pulling from the model repository.

Note that LMStudio is a commercial product - a licence is needed for non-personal usage. See [lmstudio.ai/work](https://lmstudio.ai/work).

```
LMSTUDIO_URL=http://localhost:1234
```

Replace the URL with the URL of your LMStudio API service.
